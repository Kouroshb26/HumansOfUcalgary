I was never religious before but you search for answers and you look outside of yourself for everything. \nThe biggest mistake people make when they talk to someone who is grieving is that they say they understand. You think you understand, but you don’t understand. Everyone grieves so differently, even within my family. If someone else lost their brother, I wouldn’t say I understand what they’re going through. I can try my best to understand and relate but I wouldn’t understand. I’ve lost two grandmothers, a dog, and you think those things are hard and sad at the time, and then you lose your 22 year old brother and it’s so different. It’s unlike anything I’ve ever experienced. You don’t understand and I’m so glad you don’t understand. I hope you never have to understand. It’s unbelievably sad and hard and isolating and lonely.\n\nAt the same time, grief isn’t something you can compare. Sometimes, you meet someone and they change you in a way where their absence means so much. I don’t want anyone to feel like their grief is wrong. Someone might read his obituary and feel something: they might feel a stage of grief - they might feel denial things like this happen, or anger, or anything. Never downplay your own grief because you don’t know the person well. Get help if you need it. It’s okay to talk about it. Please feel free to ask me about Mark, I love hearing the sound of his name. If someone asked me March 12th next year, hey, it’s been one year since you lost Mark, I would be so sad but also so happy people remember him. \nDon’t tell me your brother is pissing you off.

Prior to my first spaceflight, I talked to many astronauts and read many books about what it would be like to live up there. But I couldn’t possibly understand how it felt to be in space until I was there myself. The view of the earth from space is particularly enlightening. \nOn earth, we look up at the immense blue sky and may think that our atmospheric resources are boundless. From the orbital perspective, we quickly see that is not the case. If you imagine the earth as the size of a basketball, then the amount of atmosphere enveloping our planet is only a thin layer of tissue paper. From space, I saw the fragility and vulnerability of the earth: clear-cut forests resemble a patchwork quilt, ships emptying their bilge tanks into the ocean leave an oily streak in their wake. Prior to my first flight, I wondered if I would be able to see the Great Wall of China. Well, I couldn’t see the Wall from space because China was covered in smoggy haze. I had always been an environmentalist, but even more so after spaceflight. \nPhysiologically, my body has largely returned to normal following my last flight. But my wife tells me that psychologically, I returned as a different person. Whereas community and national matters previously interested me, my wife says that the global community and big ideas now capture my attention. She’s right. I think it would benefit all decision-makers to spend two or three days in space to simply look out the window and reflect on humanity and the fragility of our planet.

Once we got there, I just sat down and picked at the grass, because I really wanted to play hockey. I grew up in Florida and my neighbour would always be practicing hockey on his driveway. He was from London, Ontario and was only a couple of years older than me. For as long as I remember, I wanted to be like him. When I finally became old enough to play hockey, I fell in love with the sport. I find it amazing how hockey is the combination of two elements: physicality and skill. Not only do you have to work for every inch of the ice, but you also have to be highly skilled with handling the puck.\n\nDuring the playoffs last year, I got a concussion during game six. Injuries are definitely the hardest part of the sport. Going through the rehab process was extremely challenging. Concussions in particular are hard to deal with, because you can’t really see or judge how recovered you are. The healing process was complicated and exhausting. I didn’t even know if I would ever be able to play again. But having this experience led me to appreciate the game that much more. When we won the national championships, it was an indescribable feeling.

Comm in Marketing (2004) \"I took five years to finish my Bachelor of Commerce due to completing a co-op term in Ottawa. Taking a co-op term means that a lot of people who you started your degree with don’t graduate at the same time as you. But in turn, you get to meet a lot of new people, and you get to have unique experiences in different places. To me, working in Ottawa was the most impactful experience I had during undergrad. It was my first time away from home - I figured out how to live on my own. I also worked with a lot of ex-military people for my job; it taught me how to communicate with people of different backgrounds.\n\nToday, I work at the University following a career change from my job at Petro-Canada, one of the best decisions I could’ve made. And I would offer this piece of advice: accept the options as they come to you. Never stop looking for opportunities. Don’t worry about failures, there’s always something that comes from there.

My parents both have three sisters as well, which is why we chose the image of The Three Sisters by Canmore. My parents also have this tattoo, and my sister is thinking of getting it soon.\n\nI spent a lot of time with my grandparents. My grandfather used to be an alcoholic. When I needed major hip surgery at the age of six, he completely quit so he could devote himself to caring for me. My grandmother would wake me up for preschool and she would feed me breakfast. She taught me how to knit and was an avid painter. I have one of her paintings in my room now. My grandparents instilled the importance of family and helped me accept who I was, which was my hardest struggle. When I was younger, I had body weight issues and had few friends, so it was tough. I was always worried about how people viewed me, and they showed me the only thing that mattered was what I thought about myself. I forgave myself.

I spent six weeks living in a homeless shelter in Taiwan. It wasn’t as crazy as it seemed, because so many people were normal. But at the same time it was pretty crazy, because there were a lot of underlying mental health issues that hadn’t been addressed. One guy thought there was a government conspiracy to kill him, and that the song ‘Firework’ by Katy Perry was warning him of the plot. It was an eye-opening experience. Even though the homeless shelter there was understaffed and underfunded, the workers were all amazing. They tried to take us volunteers out to do fun activities. It sounds cheesy, but volunteering is really good for the soul. I’m more empathetic, and honestly my bed is the most comfortable place to be after sleeping on the floor and a dirty mattress with a weird black stain for weeks.\n\nBut I also learned it is very important to focus on supporting the people with the means to make a significant and sustainable change, like mental health professionals. Being a volunteer is gratifying, but at the end of the day, we aren’t the biggest players in changing these people’s lives. Volunteering in Taiwan gave me a new perspective in that as much as I wanted to help, without the education and relevant experience, I couldn’t give much more than a new item of clothing or share a funny joke with those living in the shelter.
