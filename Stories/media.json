I would love to collaborate with diverse people in interdisciplinary teams to use the medical and social aspects of health to address challenges in global health. \nI think global health is a complicated field, because of the history involved. When we think of working with underdeveloped countries, we have to remember that there are the historic and on-going impacts of colonialism at play. We have to be really careful about how we go about that. Not everyone has that knowledge. Lots of people have really good intentions to help but they don\u2019t realize that they could have damaging impacts in various countries.

They worked in other fields since they lacked qualifications needed to work in the Canadian medical system. \nIn 2006, a peace treaty was signed in Sudan. Many of the former students decided to return. They knew their medical skills would be rusty, so they asked for an upgrading program. The U of C made a nine-month full-time program for these students. Professors and physicians volunteered to teach them. I recruited volunteers, arranged for courses, so these students could return to med school in south sudan. We also did medical programs in South Sudan, in hospitals, and we also provided volunteers who provided teaching and instruction. It\u2019s now called the Sudan Physician Reintegration program.\n\nOn one of my trips to South Sudan, we stayed in tents and set up a clinic for the nearby rural communities.

They might not realize that this is the best time to get out there and embrace something new, and maybe discover what you want to be in the future. \nNow I work as an Instructor with the Haskayne School of Business and it has been amazing to give back to the program that has taught me so much. \nI came to love teaching cross-cultural studies from the great influence of a professor named Dr. Skarlicki. I can remember the exact day he spoke of it in a lecture, a light bulb flicked on in my head and I suddenly knew that was what I wanted to do. Now I teach a cross-cultural business course in Japan, and I took 22 students there in May! \nI never reached out to Dr. Skarlicki to let him know how much he influenced me. And it\u2019s odd to think that we, as professors and instructors, might not realize the kind of influence we have on students. \nSometimes I worry that I play the same role that Dr. Skarlicki did in the lives of my students, that I could impact somebody\u2019s entire life and I would never know.\u201d (1/2)", "image": "./photos/1611960879091633333.jpg"}, {"caption": "\u201cMy dream is to become an astronaut.

My 1976 mechanical engineering class included only thirty students. We learned and worked together late into the evenings and on weekends on assignments and design projects. When I handed in a problem set, for example, my name was on it. In reality, I could\u2019ve listed several other names - we helped and depended on each other.\nMy engineering undergrad was an intense program that created a tight bond between my classmates. This bond has continued over the years such that we stay in touch. Every second Tuesday of each month, the Calgary-based classmates get together for breakfast. Last year was our 40th year reunion, and twenty-two classmates made the effort to attend. A piece of advice for today\u2019s students - get to know your classmates. Help each other out. Likewise, get to know your professors. There\u2019s some professor on campus who wants to learn about your career aspirations and guide you on your educational path. The full university experience should be defined by more than lectures, labs and the C-Train ride to and from campus.\nIf you had asked me when I was an undergrad if I would ever become an astronaut, I would\u2019ve replied no. I\u2019ve subsequently learned that it is okay to dream big, hairy audacious dreams. Admittedly, some career dreams such as astronaut require a lot of education, a lot of knowledge and skills. But be determined and keep moving toward it. You might be an undergrad now but you have tremendous potential. You could become an author, a neurosurgeon or Prime Minister.

Sc. in Mechanical Engineering (1976) \u201cHow has going to space changed your life on Earth?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s crazy. Prior to my first spaceflight, I talked to many astronauts and read many books about what it would be like to live up there. But I couldn\u2019t possibly understand how it felt to be in space until I was there myself. The view of the earth from space is particularly enlightening. \nOn earth, we look up at the immense blue sky and may think that our atmospheric resources are boundless. From the orbital perspective, we quickly see that is not the case. If you imagine the earth as the size of a basketball, then the amount of atmosphere enveloping our planet is only a thin layer of tissue paper. From space, I saw the fragility and vulnerability of the earth: clear-cut forests resemble a patchwork quilt, ships emptying their bilge tanks into the ocean leave an oily streak in their wake. Prior to my first flight, I wondered if I would be able to see the Great Wall of China. Well, I couldn\u2019t see the Wall from space because China was covered in smoggy haze. I had always been an environmentalist, but even more so after spaceflight. \nPhysiologically, my body has largely returned to normal following my last flight. But my wife tells me that psychologically, I returned as a different person. Whereas community and national matters previously interested me, my wife says that the global community and big ideas now capture my attention. She\u2019s right. I think it would benefit all decision-makers to spend two or three days in space to simply look out the window and reflect on humanity and the fragility of our planet. From orbit, we don\u2019t notice individual countries; we notice only civilization. We gain the sense that all of humanity is one, that we are connected to each other and to nature, and that survival of our species should be governments\u2019 top priority.\u201d (1/3)\n\nSubscribe to our weekly newsletter: http://bit.ly/SubscribetoHumansofUCalgary", "image": "./photos/1538746008682840905.jpg"}, {"caption": "\u201c4 years later, I had been to every small town in Nebraska, from Kimball, to Madison, to even Valentine.

If a Kazak has a Russian name, he is Korean. That\u2019s something quirky about the culture there.\n\nI am from Almaty, a pretty city in the mountains. My area was not dangerous, but it was not safe. There was lots of bullying, so I became involved in martial arts to protect myself. This quickly became my first passion in life. I did taekwondo, and then boxing and jujitsu. I knew a lot of people in Kazakhastan who struggled with money, so I learned how to save money on hobbies. When I moved to Canada for boarding school, I found a lot of companies that offered free memberships or promotions at their martial arts gyms. In my two years of high school, I did martial arts pretty regularly but I only paid for three days. And even that was discounted!\"", "image": "./photos/1429438922957901794.jpg"}, {"caption": "\u201cI was on vacation in the Dominican last summer. The Dominican people are the most respectful, selfless people I have ever met. It made me so angry to see how poorly some of the tourists treated the staff. I know what it\u2019s like - I worked at Victoria\u2019s Secret and customer service is hard. Sure the tourists pay a lot of money, and sure it\u2019s the job of the staff to take care of them. But it just hurt to see people treated like they were worth less than others.
