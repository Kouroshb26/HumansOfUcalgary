The people who are left behind are the people you need to fight for. They carry the burden of grief. The person who has passed away doesn’t know what you’re experiencing. You are carrying the burden of their death and maybe you’re not mentally ill but mentally really really sick - I’ve had the most outlandish thoughts. I was never religious before but you search for answers and you look outside of yourself for everything. \nThe biggest mistake people make when they talk to someone who is grieving is that they say they understand. You think you understand, but you don’t understand. Everyone grieves so differently, even within my family. If someone else lost their brother, I wouldn’t say I understand what they’re going through. I can try my best to understand and relate but I wouldn’t understand. I’ve lost two grandmothers, a dog, and you think those things are hard and sad at the time, and then you lose your 22 year old brother and it’s so different. It’s unlike anything I’ve ever experienced. You don’t understand and I’m so glad you don’t understand. I hope you never have to understand. It’s unbelievably sad and hard and isolating and lonely.\n\nAt the same time, grief isn’t something you can compare. Sometimes, you meet someone and they change you in a way where their absence means so much. I don’t want anyone to feel like their grief is wrong. Someone might read his obituary and feel something: they might feel a stage of grief - they might feel denial things like this happen, or anger, or anything. Never downplay your own grief because you don’t know the person well. Get help if you need it. It’s okay to talk about it. Please feel free to ask me about Mark, I love hearing the sound of his name. If someone asked me March 12th next year, hey, it’s been one year since you lost Mark, I would be so sad but also so happy people remember him. \nDon’t tell me your brother is pissing you off.

Sc. in Mechanical Engineering (1976) “How has going to space changed your life on Earth?” “It’s crazy. Prior to my first spaceflight, I talked to many astronauts and read many books about what it would be like to live up there. But I couldn’t possibly understand how it felt to be in space until I was there myself. The view of the earth from space is particularly enlightening. \nOn earth, we look up at the immense blue sky and may think that our atmospheric resources are boundless. From the orbital perspective, we quickly see that is not the case. If you imagine the earth as the size of a basketball, then the amount of atmosphere enveloping our planet is only a thin layer of tissue paper. From space, I saw the fragility and vulnerability of the earth: clear-cut forests resemble a patchwork quilt, ships emptying their bilge tanks into the ocean leave an oily streak in their wake. Prior to my first flight, I wondered if I would be able to see the Great Wall of China. Well, I couldn’t see the Wall from space because China was covered in smoggy haze. I had always been an environmentalist, but even more so after spaceflight. \nPhysiologically, my body has largely returned to normal following my last flight. But my wife tells me that psychologically, I returned as a different person. Whereas community and national matters previously interested me, my wife says that the global community and big ideas now capture my attention. She’s right. I think it would benefit all decision-makers to spend two or three days in space to simply look out the window and reflect on humanity and the fragility of our planet. From orbit, we don’t notice individual countries; we notice only civilization. We gain the sense that all of humanity is one, that we are connected to each other and to nature, and that survival of our species should be governments’ top priority.” (1/3)\n\nSubscribe to our weekly newsletter: http://bit.ly/SubscribetoHumansofUCalgary", "taken_at": "2017-06-16T15:40:40", "location": "University of Calgary", "path": "photos/201706/f4b5c4fd631030cd6e8e8ae3121c9a8a.jpg"}, {"caption": "Robert Thirsk, B.

I spent six weeks living in a homeless shelter in Taiwan. It wasn’t as crazy as it seemed, because so many people were normal. But at the same time it was pretty crazy, because there were a lot of underlying mental health issues that hadn’t been addressed. One guy thought there was a government conspiracy to kill him, and that the song ‘Firework’ by Katy Perry was warning him of the plot. It was an eye-opening experience. Even though the homeless shelter there was understaffed and underfunded, the workers were all amazing. They tried to take us volunteers out to do fun activities. It sounds cheesy, but volunteering is really good for the soul. I’m more empathetic, and honestly my bed is the most comfortable place to be after sleeping on the floor and a dirty mattress with a weird black stain for weeks.\n\nBut I also learned it is very important to focus on supporting the people with the means to make a significant and sustainable change, like mental health professionals. Being a volunteer is gratifying, but at the end of the day, we aren’t the biggest players in changing these people’s lives. Volunteering in Taiwan gave me a new perspective in that as much as I wanted to help, without the education and relevant experience, I couldn’t give much more than a new item of clothing or share a funny joke with those living in the shelter. We all want to help, but it should be recognized that there is always more to it than what’s on the surface.”", "taken_at": "2017-01-16T19:13:36", "location": "University of Calgary", "path": "photos/201701/a5062f90a1e68e947e45da04620cf689.jpg"}, {"caption": "“I had my first New Year’s kiss in New York City.\n\nMy best friend and I made a pact to study abroad together. In our third year, we saw a pamphlet for the Broadway course in NYC and we decided to save up money and go. It was a dream come true. We both love acting and drama, so it felt so good to soak in the jazz bars and Broadway shows and culture of the city.\n\nI feel like love has sneaky ways of finding you. There was a boy on the trip, who I’d briefly met during orientation for the class. He was so cute. I thought he was way out of my league, so I never thought anything would happen. We got to hang out in NYC and the more we talked I realized he was pretty much the sweetest person I’d ever met. It was New Year’s Eve and our group just left the restaurant. He was keeping my hands warm, and when it was time for the countdown, we rushed out into Times Square. We kissed, and I looked up and confetti was falling and Louis Armstrong’s ‘What a Beautiful World’ was playing. I was just like, wow!”", "taken_at": "2017-01-16T19:12:04", "location": "University of Calgary", "path": "photos/201701/8154935a3b9878c7121f088e5d7e890b.jpg"}, {"caption": "“My first video was for my high school’s morning announcements. They used to show announcements on PowerPoint slides, and I thought, wouldn’t it be interesting if these were videos instead? Over the past few years, I’ve filmed everything from TV commercials for ski hills and small businesses, to the U of C Website and even my hometown of Trail, BC for tourism.\n\nEvery video is a new field trip. I’m like a sherpa, I carry all of my equipment. I get to see a lot of behind-the-scenes action, and talk to people that I ordinarily would never meet. I like doing it solo because I see film-making like creating a painting - I decide on the message, the shots, the editing, the music. I wouldn’t want anyone else to finish my half-finished painting. I’ve been very fortunate to have lots of creative freedom.”", "taken_at": "2017-01-16T19:09:17", "location": "The Taylor Family Digital Library", "path": "photos/201701/84415131fd447d7b9e8369121a87d9e1.jpg"}, {"caption": "\"My first name, Oleg, is Russian, my family is Korean, and I was born in Kazakhstan. If a Kazak has a Russian name, he is Korean. That’s something quirky about the culture there.\n\nI am from Almaty, a pretty city in the mountains. My area was not dangerous, but it was not safe. There was lots of bullying, so I became involved in martial arts to protect myself. This quickly became my first passion in life. I did taekwondo, and then boxing and jujitsu. I knew a lot of people in Kazakhastan who struggled with money, so I learned how to save money on hobbies. When I moved to Canada for boarding school, I found a lot of companies that offered free memberships or promotions at their martial arts gyms. In my two years of high school, I did martial arts pretty regularly but I only paid for three days.

The Dominican people are the most respectful, selfless people I have ever met. It made me so angry to see how poorly some of the tourists treated the staff. I know what it’s like - I worked at Victoria’s Secret and customer service is hard. Sure the tourists pay a lot of money, and sure it’s the job of the staff to take care of them. But it just hurt to see people treated like they were worth less than others.
